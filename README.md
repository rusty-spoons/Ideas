# Ideas
This is the repo that will house and described our ideas before they become a reality.

## 1. Period app
The idea is to build a period tracker that is convenient, easy and fun to use. This includes not sending people's data to some server (yay privacy!).

## 2. Music visualiser
The idea is to build a webgl or opengl (we are still unsure) project that will create a bar at the bottom of one's screen and display bars that jump up and down. How fun!

## 3. Music synthesizer
Yeah we want to build our own synthesizer (we've tried before but it is not that easy).

## 4. Blockchain
We don't know yet what will make it different but it will be! Just you wait and see!

## 5. Music collab game
This will be a fun web-based, co-op game where people will join and pick an instrument and play together without any prior music experience. I think it will be fun don't you?

## 6. Website parsers
This will scrape information off websites from which we can create other websites. How a-mei-zing?
